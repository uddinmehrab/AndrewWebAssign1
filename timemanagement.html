                <p>The number one thing that is going to make you successful at university is <a href="https://learning.uwo.ca/Support/learn2thrive/">organizing your time</a>. You are going to have deadlines that must be met...</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Get a calendar. It can be an online calendar or a paper calendar, but make sure you have one that you can keep with you at all times.</li>
                    <li>At the beginning of each term, take your course syllabus for each of your courses and put every due date (quizzes, assignments, tests) into your calendar.</li>
                    <li>Create a daily schedule. Allocate specific time slots for studying, attending class, socializing, and relaxing. Stick to your schedule as much as possible to help you develop a routine.</li>
                    <li>Minimize distractions. Find a quiet and secret spot on campus where you can concentrate without interruptions. Turn off notifications and limit your phone time during study sessions.</li>
                    <li>Follow the "3 daily tasks rule". Write down 3 things you are going to do today. For example: work 15 minutes on a project, study for 10 minutes, and do the laundry. Write them down and try to cross each item off by the end of the day.</li>
                </ul>
