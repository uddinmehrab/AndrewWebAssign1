                <p>Here are some ideas for how to be successful at Western.</p>


                <h3>Best Study Spots</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tables outside Prof. Laura's office, often empty and quiet.</li>
                    <li>East end tables on the main floor of the North Campus Building, with morning sunlight and a view of the river (you might even spot a deer).</li>
                    <li>Black Walnut Cafe in the Collip building, open 9 to 3 Monday to Friday, known for the best oatmeal cookies in London and a cozy study spot.</li>
                    <li>My Study Spot: John & Dotsa Bitove Family Law Library</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Additional Tips for Success</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attend every class:</strong> Studies show that students who attend all classes perform better. Avoid 8:30 am classes if you're not a morning person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Space out your studying:</strong> Instead of cramming, study for shorter sessions over multiple days. Spend the first 15 minutes each day reviewing the previous dayâ€™s material.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice, practice, practice:</strong> Just like with sports, practice is key to success in academic subjects, especially math. Doing problems yourself will reinforce learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teach the material:</strong> Teach concepts to a peer to deepen your understanding. Use flashcards, test each other, and ensure both understand the material well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Read the announcements and the course syllabus:</strong> Professors appreciate students who stay informed and avoid redundant questions. Knowing policies like lab makeups or assignment deadlines helps you avoid unnecessary emails.</li>
                    <li><strong>My Personal Tip:</strong> Make sure to get enough sleep as being sleep deprived makes everything worse.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3 id="announcements">Announcements and Course Syllabus</h3>
                <p>99.9% of professors at Western are supportive and want you to succeed. However, they may get tired of questions that are already answered in the syllabus, such as questions about lab makeups or late assignment submissions. Professors are usually happy to help with understanding course material but expect students to read the syllabus first.</p>
