                <h2>Wellness</h2>
                <p>We know you have heard this many times, but it is very important to take care of your physical, social, and mental wellbeing while at university.</p>


                <div class="section-links">
                    <a href="#physical" class="section-link">Physical Well-Being</a>

                </div>


                <h3 id="physical">Physical Well-Being</h3>
                <p><strong>Eat Well:</strong> Food can greatly impact your energy levels, mood, and academic performance. Try to avoid fast food every day, drink several glasses of water, and minimize sugary foods.</p>
                <p><strong>Move Well:</strong> Grab a friend and explore Western’s trails or visit the rec center. Physical activity improves brain function and can help with exams.</p>
                <p><strong>Sleep Well:</strong> Stick to a regular bedtime if possible. Avoid caffeine or alcohol before bed, keep a consistent wake-up time, and create a quiet, dark, cool environment for sleep.</p>


                <h3 id="social">Social Well-Being</h3>
                <p><strong>Engage Well:</strong> Consider joining a club or volunteering. If clubs aren’t for you, volunteering can be another way to connect with people on campus.</p>
                <p><strong>Chat Well:</strong> Find friends with shared interests and stay in touch with family and friends online. If you’re in residence, try spending time in common areas to meet new people.</p>


                <h3 id="mental">Mental Well-Being</h3>
                <p><strong>Think Well:</strong> Focus on what you can control. When overwhelmed, find one manageable task and complete it. Breaking down tasks can reduce stress.</p>
                <p><strong>Breathe Well:</strong> Identify what brings you joy (e.g., reading, music, or nature) and make time for it. When anxious, try deep breathing or stretch by a sunny window.</p>
                <p><strong>Laugh Well:</strong> <img src="images/laugh_image.jpg" alt="A lighthearted image to make you smile" title='Laugh Well Image' width="300"></p>
